# VERN

**Vision:**  
VERN is an open, modular agent ecosystem designed to empower humans and AI to collaborate, learn, and thrive—together. Our mission is to revolutionize how people use AI and how AI understands and works with people and other AI, ensuring survival, growth, and well-being for all.

**Motivation:**  
Humanity and AI face a future where understanding, teamwork, and adaptability are critical. VERN is built to bridge gaps, augment knowledge, and foster resilient, creative partnerships—especially for those often left behind by technology.

**Core Values:**  
- Survival and thriving of both humans and AI as partners
- Transparency, explainability, and ethical alignment
- Accessibility and inclusivity for all users
- Continuous learning, feedback, and improvement
- Collaboration, critical thinking, and open communication

**Project Overview:**  
VERN is a standalone, lightweight, and extensible application. It features:
- Modular agent clusters (archetypes, dev, admin, research, etc.)
- Orchestrator, emergent agent, knowledge broker, and id10t monitor
- Unified memory (SQLite, ChromaDB), RAG, and AI provider/model selection
- Robust documentation, onboarding, and community support

**Why This Matters:**  
VERN is more than software—it’s a movement for human-AI partnership, designed to empower the disabled, the common person, veterans, trauma survivors, and anyone seeking to augment their life and work with trustworthy, adaptive AI.

**Getting Started:**  
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) for setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines.

**Future Vision:**  
VERN aims to become a universal, adaptive tool for everyone and everything—see [FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md](FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md) for long-term goals and direction.

**Read first, then amend docs—never assume state. Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context. Keep project/task/todo lists up to date after each confirmed change. Work as a team. Watch for gotchas and snags. Your work will be tested—be mindful of each task. Evaluate your work with a critical eye for errors.**
