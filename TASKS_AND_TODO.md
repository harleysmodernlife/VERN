# Task and TODO List for VERN Project

## Prompt Utilities and Standardization
- [ ] Create a new module (`src/mvp/prompt_utils.py`) for centralized prompt construction.
- [ ] Refactor `dev_team_agent.py` and `knowledge_broker.py` to use the new prompt utilities.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the prompt utility functions to ensure consistency.

## Error Handling and Escalation
- [ ] Refactor `route_llm_call` (or wrap its output) to return structured error responses (e.g., JSON with error codes) instead of raw strings.
- [ ] Centralize error escalation logic into a common utility function that all agents use.
- [ ] Replace substring-based error detection with checks against structured error responses.
- [ ] Rename ambiguous logging functions (e.g., update `log_gotcha` to `log_exception`) and standardize logging across modules.

## Enhanced Context Processing
- [ ] Improve the `process_context` function to handle nested data structures without overly aggressive transformations (avoid unintended capitalization of technical terms).
- [ ] Introduce configuration flags in the context processor to enable fine-tuned control over transformations.

## Modularization of Common Logic
- [ ] Extract redundant logic (such as logging, prompt assembly, and escalation patterns) into shared utility modules.
- [ ] Update documentation (e.g., README, developer docs) to reflect the new modular structure.

## Asynchronous Support
- [ ] Evaluate and prototype asynchronous processing using asyncio for functions like `route_llm_call` and key agent operations.
- [ ] Implement asynchronous versions with synchronous wrappers for backward compatibility.

## Testing and Continuous Integration
- [ ] Extend unit tests for all refactored modules, including prompt utilities, error handling, and context processing.
- [ ] Develop integration tests that simulate multi-agent workflows and negative feedback scenarios.
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines to include these new tests in the build process.

## Iterative Refactoring and Documentation
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Implement utilities for prompt construction and improve error handling.
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Enhance context processing and integrate asynchronous support.
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Run comprehensive tests, address edge cases, and integrate all changes.
- [ ] Update all relevant project documentation with new module interfaces, configuration options, and refactoring details.
