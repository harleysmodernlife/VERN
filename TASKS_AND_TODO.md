# VERN Tasks & TODO

## Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Update LLM integration tests to check for real LLM output (not just [FakeLLM]).
- [ ] Add a health check script for Ollama/model status before running tests.
- [ ] Improve agent prompts and tool access for more actionable LLM output.
- [ ] Document RAM requirements and troubleshooting for Ollama in QUICKSTART.md and KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_GOTCHAS.md.
- [ ] Explore smaller or more capable models for low-resource hardware.
- [ ] Add more agent workflows and features.
- [ ] Update AGENT_GUIDES/README.md and MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with new backend and modularity notes.
- [ ] Regularly review and update docs as new models/providers become available.

---

## Longer-Term

- [ ] Add system prompt support and agent tool-calling for advanced LLMs.
- [ ] Modularize agent tool integration (code execution, web search, etc.).
- [ ] Add web/chat UI for user experience upgrade.
- [ ] Expand automated test coverage for all agent workflows.
- [ ] Monitor Ollama and Hugging Face for new model releases and update backends as needed.
- [ ] Continue improving accessibility and internationalization.
