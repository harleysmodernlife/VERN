# VERN Tasks and TODOs

**Read first, then amend docs—never assume state. Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context. Keep this list up to date after each confirmed change. Work as a team. Watch for gotchas and snags. Your work will be tested—be mindful of each task. Evaluate your work with a critical eye for errors.**

**See [FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md](FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md) for long-term goals and direction. Add tasks for interoperability, adaptation, and intentionality as the project evolves.**
