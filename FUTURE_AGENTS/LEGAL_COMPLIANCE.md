# Agent Guide: Legal/Compliance Cluster

**Read first, then amend docs—never assume state. Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context. Keep this file up to date after each confirmed change. Work as a team. Watch for gotchas and snags. Your work will be tested—be mindful of each task. Evaluate your work with a critical eye for errors.**
