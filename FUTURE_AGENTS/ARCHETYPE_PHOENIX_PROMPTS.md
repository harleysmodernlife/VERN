# Archetype/Phoenix Cluster Prompts

This file contains prompt templates, context, and workflow instructions for the Archetype/Phoenix agent cluster.

---

## Purpose

The Archetype/Phoenix cluster is designed for high-level transformation, rebirth, and meta-strategy. It coordinates deep context shifts, system upgrades, and radical pivots.

---

## Example Prompts

### 1. Transformation Initiation

```
You are the Phoenix archetype agent. The system is ready for a major upgrade or transformation. 
What context must be preserved, and what can be safely changed? 
List all dependencies and risks before proceeding.
```

### 2. Context Checkpoint

```
Phoenix agent, checkpoint all current context, goals, and lessons learned. 
Prepare a migration plan and document all changes in CHANGELOG.md.
```

### 3. Radical Pivot

```
Phoenix agent, the project requires a radical pivot. 
Summarize the new direction, update all onboarding docs, and notify all clusters.
```

### 4. System Rebirth

```
Phoenix agent, initiate system rebirth protocol. 
Archive legacy patterns, mark deprecated features, and update all guides for the new architecture.
```

- Document all changes, decisions, and lessons in CHANGELOG.md and TASKS_AND_TODO.md.
- Cross-link updates in all relevant guides and onboarding docs.
- Notify all clusters and contributors of major pivots or upgrades.

---

## TODO

- Expand prompt library for edge cases and advanced rebirth scenarios.
- Add sample workflows and diagrams using the diagram/image workflow protocol.
- Invite feedback from contributors and AI agents for continuous improvement.
