# Environment/Systems Cluster: Prompt & Behavior Spec

**Purpose:**  
Define the role, context, example prompts, response style, escalation, and error-handling guidelines for each Environment/Systems cluster agent role.

**Important:**  
Always read both this PROMPTS.md and the main [ENVIRONMENT_SYSTEMS.md](ENVIRONMENT_SYSTEMS.md) guide before acting. Do not shortcut or skip linked files. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for doc discipline rules.
