# Contributing to VERN

Welcome! VERN thrives on teamwork, transparency, and critical thinking. This guide ensures every contributor—human or AI—helps build a robust, ethical, and future-proof system.

**New contributors:**  
Start with [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for setup, and see [FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md](FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md) for the project’s long-term direction.

## Core Principles (Read First!)

- **Read first, then amend docs—never assume state.**
- **Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context.**
- **Keep project/task/todo lists up to date after each confirmed change.**
- **Work as a team—communicate, document, and cross-check.**
- **Watch for gotchas, snags, and edge cases.**
- **Your work will be tested—be mindful and thorough.**
- **Evaluate your work critically for errors and improvement.**

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo and clone locally.**
2. **Read all relevant docs before making changes.**
3. **Review [SECURITY_AND_GIT_GUIDELINES.md](SECURITY_AND_GIT_GUIDELINES.md) before handling any code, config, or API keys.**
4. **Open an issue or discussion for major changes or new features.**
5. **Follow code standards and naming conventions.**
6. **Update documentation and task lists after each confirmed change.**
7. **Test your work—automated and manual tests are required.**
8. **Submit a pull request with a clear description and checklist.**
9. **Be open to feedback and ready to iterate.**

## Communication & Teamwork

- Use clear, respectful language in all discussions.
- Document decisions, rationale, and lessons learned.
- Cross-check your work with teammates and AI agents.
- Raise concerns about ethics, alignment, or system safety immediately.

---

## Code & Documentation Standards

- Modular, readable, and well-commented code.
- Consistent formatting (auto-formatters recommended).
- Docs must be updated with every change—no exceptions.
- Use checklists and status updates in issues and PRs.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- All new features and fixes must include tests.
- Manual testing for edge cases and user flows.
- Log errors, unexpected behavior, and lessons learned.

---

## Values & Alignment

- Prioritize survival, well-being, and empowerment of both humans and AI.
- Strive for transparency, explainability, and ethical alignment.
- Foster accessibility, inclusivity, and continuous improvement.

---

## Doc Discipline & Cross-Referencing

- **Never shortcut documentation.** Always read both the main cluster guide and its PROMPTS.md before acting.
- **Follow all cross-links.** If a file links to another doc, you must read and follow both.
- **Update all relevant docs and cross-links** when making changes. Log updates in CHANGELOG.md.
- **Pull requests must confirm** that all relevant docs and cross-links are up to date.
- **AI and human contributors:** Skipping or ignoring linked docs is considered a critical error.
