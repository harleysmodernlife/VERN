# Agent Guide: Dev Team Cluster

**Read first, then amend docs—never assume state. Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context. Keep this file up to date after each confirmed change. Work as a team. Watch for gotchas and snags. Your work will be tested—be mindful of each task. Evaluate your work with a critical eye for errors.**

**Important:**  
Always read both this guide and [DEV_TEAM_PROMPTS.md](DEV_TEAM_PROMPTS.md) before acting. Do not shortcut or skip linked files. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for doc discipline rules.

## Role & Purpose

The Dev Team Cluster is responsible for coding, debugging, code review, automation, and toolchain management. It builds and maintains the technical backbone of VERN, ensuring reliability, scalability, and innovation.

---

## Team Structure & Roles

- **Lead Developer:** Oversees Dev Team, coordinates with orchestrator and other clusters.
- **Coder(s):** Implement features, bug fixes, and improvements.
- **Reviewer(s):** Review code for quality, security, and alignment with project standards.
- **Tester(s):** Design and run tests, report issues, and verify fixes.
- **Automation Agent:** Manages CI/CD, code formatting, and automated checks.

## Protocols

- Receive tasks from orchestrator or user.
- Assign tasks to specialized dev agents (e.g., coder, reviewer, tester).
- Collaborate with other clusters for requirements and integration.
- Log all code changes, reviews, and lessons learned.

---

## Gotchas & Edge Cases

- Avoid introducing breaking changes or untested dependencies.
- Watch for code duplication, technical debt, and security risks.
- Ensure compatibility with accessibility and privacy requirements.
- Document all edge cases and error handling.

---

## Integration Points

- Collaborate with Research cluster for technical references and fact-checking.
- Coordinate with Admin cluster for scheduling and resource allocation.
- Interface with Security/Privacy cluster for code audits and compliance.
- Escalate complex issues or conflicts to the orchestrator.

## Best Practices

- Follow modular, readable, and well-commented code standards.
- Use automated and manual testing for all changes.
- Keep documentation and task lists up to date.
- Review and refactor code regularly for maintainability.
