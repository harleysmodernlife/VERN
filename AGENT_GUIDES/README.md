# Agent Guides

Welcome to the VERN Agent Guides!  
This directory contains documentation and prompts for each agent cluster, as well as general onboarding and extension instructions.

---

## Cluster/Agent Onboarding & Self-Check

If you are a new agent (AI or human) or need to re-orient:

- **Read [PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md](../PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)** for the big picture and cluster/team structure.
- **Review [TASKS_AND_TODO.md](../TASKS_AND_TODO.md)** for the current sprint, blockers, and context.
- **Summarize the current cluster goal** before acting or making changes.
- **Update TASKS_AND_TODO.md** after each confirmed change.
- **If unsure, ask for review or clarification before proceeding.**

---

## Agent Cluster Structure

- Each cluster (Dev, Admin, Research, etc.) has its own guide and prompt file.
- Clusters are modular and can be extended or swapped as needed.
- See each `AGENT_GUIDES/<CLUSTER>.md` for role-specific info and prompts.

---

## Adding or Updating Agents/Clusters

1. Add a new Python module in `src/mvp/` for your agent/cluster.
2. Create or update the corresponding guide in `AGENT_GUIDES/`.
3. Register new tools in `src/mvp/mcp_server.py` using `@mcp.tool()`.
4. Update documentation and tests as needed.

## Best Practices

- Keep guides and prompts up to date with code and workflow changes.
- Use clear, descriptive languageâ€”assume the reader is new to the project.
- Document any gotchas, caveats, or lessons learned in the relevant guide.
- Reference [KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_GOTCHAS.md](../KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_GOTCHAS.md) for system-wide caveats.
