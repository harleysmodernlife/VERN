# Emergent Agent: Prompt & Behavior Spec

**Purpose:**  
Define the role, context, example prompts, response style, escalation, and error-handling guidelines for each Emergent Agent role.

**Important:**  
Always read both this PROMPTS.md and the main [EMERGENT_AGENT.md](EMERGENT_AGENT.md) guide before acting. Do not shortcut or skip linked files. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for doc discipline rules.
