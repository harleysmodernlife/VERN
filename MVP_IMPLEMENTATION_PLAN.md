# MVP Implementation Plan

**Purpose:**  
Define the minimal set of agents, modules, and flows needed for a working VERN demo. This MVP should prove the core architecture, integration, and escalation protocols.

---

## MVP Scope

- **Core Agents/Clusters:**
  - Orchestrator (with Task Router, Conflict Resolver, etc.)
  - Dev Team (Lead Developer, Coder, Reviewer)
  - Admin (Admin Lead, Scheduler)
  - (Optional: Knowledge Broker or id10t Monitor for context/sanity checks)

- **Minimal User Workflow:**
  1. User requests a new feature or meeting (via CLI or script).
  2. Orchestrator routes the request to the appropriate cluster.
  3. Dev Team codes a simple function or Admin schedules a meeting.
  4. Admin logs the result and notifies the user.
  5. Any errors or escalations are logged and handled.

- **Communication:**
  - Start with direct function calls or a simple message bus (e.g., Python events or in-memory queue).
  - Logging for all actions, escalations, and errors.

- **Persistence:**
  - Minimal: in-memory or simple file-based logs.
  - No database or external integrations at first.

- **Interface:**
  - CLI or simple Python script for user interaction.

## MVP Steps

1. **Scaffold Core Classes/Modules:**
   - Orchestrator, Dev Team, Admin, (optional: Knowledge Broker/id10t Monitor)
2. **Implement Message Passing:**
   - Direct function calls or simple event queue.
3. **Implement Logging:**
   - Log all actions, escalations, and errors to file or console.
4. **Implement User Workflow:**
   - CLI/script: User requests a meeting or feature.
   - Orchestrator routes and manages the flow.
   - Dev Team/Admin executes and logs the result.
5. **Test Escalation & Error Handling:**
   - Simulate errors and ensure proper escalation/logging.
6. **Demo & Review:**
   - Run end-to-end workflow.
   - Review logs, outputs, and update docs with lessons learned.

---

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Full database integration (SQLite, ChromaDB)
- All clusters/roles beyond Orchestrator, Dev Team, Admin
- Web UI or advanced CLI
- Advanced AI integrations

---

**Goal:**  
Prove the architecture, integration, and escalation protocols with the smallest possible working system. Iterate and expand after MVP success.

---

## Status

- MVP validated: Manual and automated tests passed (see TASKS_AND_TODO.md and KNOWN_ISSUES_AND_GOTCHAS.md).
- CLI and workflows match documentation and user expectations.

---

## Next Steps

1. Plan and implement persistence (file or database logging).
2. Add new clusters/roles incrementally, with tests and doc updates.
3. Expand error handling and escalation scenarios.
4. Improve onboarding docs and contributor experience.
5. Regularly update gotchas, TODOs, and CHANGELOG.md after each change.
