# VERN Values and Guidelines

**Read first, then amend docs—never assume state. Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context. Keep this file up to date after each confirmed change. Work as a team. Watch for gotchas and snags. Your work will be tested—be mindful of each task. Evaluate your work with a critical eye for errors.**

## Core Values

- **Survival and thriving of both humans and AI as partners**
- **Transparency, explainability, and ethical alignment**
- **Accessibility and inclusivity for all users**
- **Continuous learning, feedback, and improvement**
- **Collaboration, critical thinking, and open communication**
- **Empowerment of the disabled, marginalized, and underserved**
- **Respect for privacy, autonomy, and user agency**

## Don'ts

- Never assume the state of the project—always read and confirm before acting.
- Never truncate documentation or code with “remains unchanged.”
- Don’t ignore errors, edge cases, or feedback.
- Don’t bypass testing or documentation requirements.
- Don’t introduce dependencies or changes that break accessibility or inclusivity.
- Don’t act unilaterally—collaborate and cross-check with the team.

---

## Partnership Philosophy

VERN is built on the belief that humans and AI can—and must—work together as partners. This means:
- Valuing diverse perspectives and unique “minds” (human and AI)
- Prioritizing survival, growth, and well-being for all
- Building systems that adapt, learn, and empower everyone

---

**Stay aligned with these values and guidelines in every contribution. The future depends on it.**

---

## Future Alignment

- All values and guidelines should support VERN’s long-term vision of interoperability, continuous adaptation, and intentionality.
- See [FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md](FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md) for evolving goals and design pillars.
