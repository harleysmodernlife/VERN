# VERN Goals and Milestones

**Read first, then amend docs—never assume state. Never truncate with “remains unchanged”—always show full, updated context. Keep this list up to date after each confirmed change. Work as a team. Watch for gotchas and snags. Your work will be tested—be mindful of each task. Evaluate your work with a critical eye for errors.**

## Vision

Empower humans and AI to collaborate, learn, and thrive—together—by building a modular, accessible, and ethical agent ecosystem.

**See [FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md](FUTURE_VISION_AND_ROADMAP.md) for long-term direction, including interoperability, adaptation, and intentionality as core goals.**

## Current Goals

- Establish robust, modular architecture for agent clusters and orchestrators
- Implement unified memory (SQLite, ChromaDB) and RAG
- Provide configurable AI provider/model selection
- Ensure accessibility, privacy, and transparency from the start
- Build clear onboarding, documentation, and contribution guides
- Enable plugin/agent marketplace and community feedback channels
- Lay groundwork for interoperability with devices, platforms, and AIs
- Build in continuous adaptation (red-teaming, self-improvement)
- Align all actions and features with user goals, values, and ethical principles
